Description: For Bayesian inference in undirected graphical models using spike-and-slab priors, continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian graphical models' literature, including Wang (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-BA916>. To speed up the computations, the computationally intensive tasks of the package are implemented in C++ in parallel using OpenMP.
